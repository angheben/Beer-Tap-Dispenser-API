Everyone knows how boring is to wait for long queues in bars

So a good solution for that it's a responsive API able to calculate how many times a user have used a dispenser and calculate the final price to pay

In this project I develop a simlulation of a Beer Dispenser to solve this problem

The idea here it's to simulate an user filling his cup with his favorite beer and every time he does it, an API is generating as an answer

In the menu we have a very simple intro video

Bellow to this video you will have a table with some register beers and 2 buttons as you can see bellow

When you simulate a fill cup the answer will be this API:

For this project I've used Django, Django REST and SQLite for my backend development and HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap for my front-end development

Enjoy!
